# GLFW-window
This repositore only contains sample C++ code that initializes and runs a GLFW window that can be later used for
displaying graphics generated by OpenGL functions.

This code was written using the Visual Studion 2017 Community IDE on Windows 10, and the libraries used are 
**32 bit** libraries as I wasn't able to use 64 bit GLEW.
