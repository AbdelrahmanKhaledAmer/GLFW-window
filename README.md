# GLFW-window
This repositore only contains sample C++ code that initializes and runs a GLFW window that can be later used for
displaying graphics generated by OpenGL functions.

This code was written using the Visual Studion 2017 Community IDE on Windows 10, and the libraries used are 
**32 bit** libraries as I wasn't able to use 64 bit GLEW.

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository was not written by myself. It was written by the people at https://learnopengl.com/.

I used their code and changed the comments such that they seem more reasonable to myself, and so that others may benefit from it.

https://learnopengl.com/ is a great source to learn from if you are still a beginner.
